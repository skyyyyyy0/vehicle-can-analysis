# Vehicle CAN Telemetry Analytics Pipeline

## Overview

This project analyzes raw vehicle CAN telemetry data extracted from MF4 files.

The goal of this project was to identify meaningful CAN signal behavior, validate driving-state patterns, detect anomalous signal transitions, and build an end-to-end cloud-based analytics pipeline using Python, AWS S3, Athena, SQL, and Tableau.

This project simulates a real-world telemetry analytics workflow:

→ Python Signal Processing
→ CSV Export
→ AWS S3 Storage
→ Athena SQL Analysis
→ Tableau Dashboard Visualization
```

---

## Objectives

- Parse and analyze raw MF4 CAN telemetry files
- Extract CAN signal data into structured CSV format
- Investigate byte-level CAN signal behavior
- Compare driving vs idle telemetry patterns
- Detect extreme Byte 4 transition events
- Validate signal behavior across multiple MF4 sessions
- Build a cloud-based analytics pipeline using AWS Athena and Tableau

## Key Analysis Areas

### 1. CAN Signal Exploration

- Extracted CAN data from MF4 files
- Parsed timestamp, CAN ID, and byte-level values
- Selected CAN ID 111 as the main candidate signal
- Analyzed Byte 4 and Byte 5 behavior patterns

### 2. Driving vs Idle Segmentation

- Created a heuristic segmentation method using Byte 4 transition magnitude
- Compared signal behavior between driving and idle states
- Found that driving states produced much larger transition magnitudes than idle states

### 3. Multi-file Validation

- Processed multiple MF4 files
- Extracted CAN ID 111 across all validation datasets
- Compared Byte 4 transition behavior across sessions
- Classified sessions into stable, mixed, and dynamic behavior groups

### 4. Anomaly Detection

- Used Byte 4 transition magnitude to identify extreme transition events
- Defined high-magnitude transitions as anomaly candidates
- Visualized anomaly concentration regions in Tableau

## Tableau Dashboard Features

The final Tableau dashboard includes:

- KPI Summary Panel
- Driving vs Idle Transition Comparison
- Driving State Distribution
- Session Behavior Comparison
- Extreme Transition Event Visualization
- Anomaly Detection Panel
- Interactive filters for session and driving state analysis

---

## KPI Metrics

The dashboard includes the following KPIs:

- Total CAN Records
- Dynamic Transition Count
- Driving Ratio
- Anomaly Event Count

---

## Key Findings

- Idle records accounted for a large portion of the dataset, but signal changes were minimal during idle states.
- Driving records showed significantly higher Byte 4 transition magnitudes.
- Extreme Byte 4 transitions were concentrated in specific telemetry regions.
- Multi-file validation showed that dynamic transition behavior appeared repeatedly across multiple MF4 sessions.
- The signal behavior could be separated into stable, mixed, and dynamic session patterns.

## Athena SQL Queries

Reusable Athena SQL queries were created for:

- Signal frequency analysis
- Byte 4 trend analysis
- Driving vs idle comparison
- Anomaly detection
- Session-level summary analysis

Example query files:

```text
outputs/athena_queries/
├── 01_signal_frequency.sql
├── 02_byte4_trend.sql
├── 03_driving_idle.sql
├── 04_anomaly_detection.sql
└── 05_session_summary.sql
```
